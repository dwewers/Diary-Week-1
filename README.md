# Diary-Week-1
Code for personal repository [Lab Zero]:

git checkoout -b dev 
 git checkout -b bugFix
  git add .
   git commit -m "[text]"
    git push origin bugFix

git checkout dev
 git merge bugFix
  git commit -m "[text]"
   git push origin dev

git checkout master
 git merge dev
  git commit -m "[text]"
   git push origin master

(------------------------)

Code for group task:

cd .\NewTeamShinn\
 git pull 
  git checkout a
   git add .
    git commit -m "Daniel
     git push origin a

The first thing we covered was how to clone a new repository and place it into our workspaace outside of the other repositories. We have also learned how to open the repository in a new tab on its own using the command "code ." This means we can work in that repository without getting mixed up with the other repositories. We then learned how to insert text like this using 'git commit -m [insert text here]'


What have I learnt?
I learned the process in which we repository in which we are able to use as a group and develop it as in a group.

Why have i learned this?
I believe I have learned this as it is very useful when working as a team om a project. In doing this, we have learned that it is 
very important to comunicate with eachother in order to avoid mistakes or getting ahead of eachother.

How have Learned this?
Through prior knowledge of creating repositories and the help of putting our knowledge together to get the final product.
There were a few issues along the way in achieving this such as an error that we were getting when we were trying to push the origin
which in our case was "git push origin a."

The error we were getting was "fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/shinn-krammerIT/TeamShinn.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403"

We were able to resolve this issue by finding a collaboration feature in the settings, and inviting each member to the group. In doing this
we were then able to all contribute to the process and push our sectionn of code to the main area.
